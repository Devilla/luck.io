# System Architecture Overview

Luck.io’s system comprises a Solana on-chain backend (the Proov Protocol) coupled with Luck.io’s off-chain game servers and web interface. The architecture can be summarized as follows:

·      Proov On-Chain Programs: The core of Luck.io’s casino operations runs on two Solana smart contracts provided by Proov\[[4](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]:

·      Vault Program – an on-chain vault that escrows player funds during gameplay. Players deposit SOL or SPL tokens into the Vault (also referred to as a “bankroll contract”), which locks funds and later releases payouts or burns losses according to game outcomes\[[11](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]. The vault holds the pooled bankroll and, if necessary, a cold reserve for large payouts\[[25](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]\[[26](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)].

* Slot (Game) Program – an on-chain program that interfaces with games, tracking bets and outcomes. It records metrics like total wagered/won and triggers settlement by instructing the Vault to credit or debit player balances based on game results\[[12](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]. This program does not contain the full game logic for determining wins; it relies on inputs from the off-chain game engine.
* Decentralized VRF Oracles: Randomness is sourced via Proov’s VRF (Verifiable Random Function) network. When a player places a bet, a request is sent to multiple off-chain oracle nodes (run by Proov/Luck.io) which generate a random seed and return a signed VRF output on-chain\[[1](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]\[[2](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]. The VRF uses Ed25519 cryptographic signatures to allow anyone to verify that the random number is authentic and unmodified\[[6](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]. In theory, this provides provably fair entropy recorded on-chain for each bet.
* Luck.io Off-Chain Game Engine: The actual game outcome logic – e.g. slot reel generation, card draws, Plinko paths, etc. – is executed by Luck.io’s backend servers using the VRF random seed as input\[[42](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]. The mapping from random input to win/lose result occurs off-chain in proprietary code. Once the outcome is determined, the result (win amount, if any) is sent to the on-chain Slot program, which instructs the Vault to pay the player or update balances accordingly\[[11](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]\[[12](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]. The user’s web client only sees the front-end result but can theoretically cross-verify the randomness on-chain.
* Player Wallet and UI: Players interact via Luck.io’s web interface, connecting a Solana wallet. A user session begins by depositing tokens into the on-chain Vault (via a transaction the user signs). The casino front-end then lets the user place bets, which are authorized by the user (often via an off-chain signature for convenience) and relayed to the backend. Each bet triggers an on-chain VRF request and, after the outcome is resolved, the smart contracts handle payout from the Vault to the user’s wallet automatically if the user wins\[[24](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]. Withdrawals of remaining balance are done on-chain from the Vault back to the user’s wallet on demand.
* Administrative Keys & Upgrade Authority: The deployment is currently not trustless in terms of governance. The Luck.io/Proov team retains upgrade or admin authority over the Solana programs (as is common for upgradable Solana programs), though details are not publicly disclosed\[[30](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]. Likewise, the VRF oracle nodes are permissioned by the team. There is no indication of a DAO or external governance controlling contract upgrades, parameter changes, or oracle operations\[[31](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)]\[[32](https://dev-koold.gitbook.io/crypto/evidence)].

This architecture provides non-custodial fund management and transparent randomness on-chain, but it centralizes control over game logic and critical configuration. The following sections analyze the implications and risks in each area.
